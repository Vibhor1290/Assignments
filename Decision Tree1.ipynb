    "1. We need a have a deep knowledge of problem domain, business requirements and expectations. Also, identification of key performance indicators (KPIs) matters a lot.\n",

    "2. Observe the class distribution carefully within the dataset to confirm whether data is balanced or imbalanced. On the basis of that, we will proceed with using appropriate techniques for further model analysis.\n",

    "3. Leverage domain knowledge and expertise to guide the selection of evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make sure to keep monitoring the model performance(on regular basis) using chosen evaluation metric and iterate on model improvements, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or algorithm selection to optimize performance based on the selected metric."
