    "This term refers to the challenges and issues that we encounter while working with high-dimensional data in ML and data analysis. With the increase in number of features in a dataset, several problems emerges some of which are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In high-dimensional spaces, data points become more spread out which further leads to difficulty in finding meaningful patterns or relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High-dimensional data require more computational resources and time for processing and analysis. Hence, we have to find a perfect balance for the number of features to make the model effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. With significantly large number of features, the training models might become overly complex and fit noise in the data thus resulting in overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. However, more data is required for a model to undertand the actual data pattern and give precise accuracy. At the same time, gathering and managing large volumes of data can be challenging and costly."

    "1. Filter Methods: These methods evaluate the importance of features based on statistical measures or domain knowledge before training the model. Some of the common techniques include correlation, information gain, and chi-square test. \n",

Embedded methods combines feature selection into the model training process by automatically selecting or penalizing features during model training on the basis of their contribution to the model performance. Techniques such as Lasso and Elastic Net combine feature selection with regularization to encourage sparse feature sets."

    "    \n",
    "    1. When we are reducing the features from data via techniques like Principal Component Analysis, there are chances that we night lose some important information which could further impact the model ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n",

    "    2. Some dimensionality reduction techniques especially t-SNE or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) might be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n",

    "    3. Dimensionality reduction techniques can enhance the risk of overfitting, especially if the reduced-dimensional representation is not carefully selected or if the dimensionality reduction is applied too aggressively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA assume a linear relationship between variables. But if the relation is non-linear, the model might not capture the full complexity of the data, leading to suboptimal representations."

We can also use Principal Component Analysis and analyze the explained variance ratio for each principal component which indicates the proportion of variance in the original data that is captured by each principal component.
